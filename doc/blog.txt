Concordion requires a .java file with the same name as a html test file in order to run the test.
In practice these .java files are mostly empty <describe specific example here> and are therefore waste.
To fix this we generate a .class file that runs the test.

git clone git@github.com:jvermeir/concordionDemo

ConcordionRunner generates a class using a template. The template can be simple, just extend a base fixture.
in the example FixtureTemplate extends MyFixture. MyFixture holds all fixture code to connect the test to the
application under test.
HelloWorldAgain.html is the actual Concordion test. It shows the call to getGreeting(), which is a method of
MyFixture.

Example shows how to use ConcordionRunner to execute a test. This could easily be extended to recursively go through
a directory and execute all tests found. Note that Example writes the generated class to a file. This may help in
troubleshooting but isn't really necessary.
